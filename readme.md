API for my Personal CRM.

Purpose: Track WITHOUT needing to create contacts 

WIP:
- Tag a person, i.e. email address or Contact

To-Do:
- Combine email addresses into a single Contact, only email primary address?
- Sort by tags vs latest datetime
- Export lists of contacts and features for mail merges, ex. name, email, company
